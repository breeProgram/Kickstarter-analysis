# Kickstarter-analysis
Performing analysis on kickstarter data to uncover trends
## Introduction
  Louise is looking to know how different campaigns fared in relation to their launch dates and their funding goals. Looking into the results of these factors can help with deciding when best to launch a kickstarter project and the chance of its success base on its goal amount. While using the kickstarter dataset, I was able to sort and filter two different graphs to visualize what Louise is looking for. The first is theater outcomes based on their launch dates and the second is outcomes based on their goals. A conclusion can be made from both visualizations as well as a conclusion about why Louise's play Fever came close to its fundraising goal.
  
## First visualization

  To make the first conclusion, I created a graph to show the outcomes of all theater kickstarters projects throughout the years and their date created by months. This chart displays successful, failed, and canceled kickstarted productions. Through this chart, you can visualize a higher chance of a successful kickstart for a theater production is possible during the spring, April to June, and the lowest chance of a successful kickstart in the fall to winter. A second conclusion can also be made from this graph about one of the worst months to launch a kickstarter project. December is one of the worst months to launch because it has the lowest difference between successful and failed kickstarter projects with 37 successful and 35 failed productions recorded, and also having the lowest amount of successful kickstarter projects.

## Second visualization

  The third conclusion comes from the other second graph that shows the outcomes of all plays kickstarter projects based on their initial goal amount. Kickstarter projects with a goal of $5,000 or less have higher than 60% chance on being successful in reaching their goal. Kickstarter projects with a goal of $1000 or less have 73% chance of reaching their goal and only 27% chance of failing. Kickstarter projects with a goal between $20,000 and $35,000 turn out to have a higher chance of failing their goal. Kickstarter projects with a goal between $25,000 and $29,999 have up to 80% chance of failing and 20% chance of success.

## Summary
  While working through the data to build the visualizations I also noticed some limitations with the data. For example, while building the outcomes based on goal graph, I noticed that the goal range 45,000 to 49,999 for kickstarter goal amount had only 1 total kickstarter project, compared to the less than 1,000 goal range that had 251 total projects to analyze with. Having more projects or data points in each of the goal ranges allows for a more confident conclusion while analyzing the graph.

  While working through both graphs I realized that one more graph would have been helpful in answering Louise’s question. Having a graph to compare how long a kickstarter project was created and ended with the project being successful or failed. Louise’s play Fever came close to its fundraising goal be short $400 in just a months’ time. It had a goal of $2,885 and started its fundraising in June. Its low fundraising goal, under $4,999, would give it 73% chance of success and 27% chance of failing. Plus, the kickstarter project starting in June also would have given it a higher chance of success with over 50 more kickstarter projects succeeding than failing. If the kickstarter project for the play Fever were to stay open a little longer, the odds of it reaching its goal were higher than most kickstarter projects, because Fever had a lower goal amount and the kickstarter happened during the summer. That type of conclusion could be made with an extra graph compare dates with results.
